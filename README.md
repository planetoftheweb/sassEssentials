# Sass Essential Training
This is the repository for my course, [Sass Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/Sass-tutorials/Sass-Essential-Training/375925-2.html) on [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

## Course Description
Learn the fundamentals of Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass), a modern web development language that helps you write CSS better, faster, and with more advanced features. Ray Villalobos shows you the best way to install Sass and work with its main features: variables, nesting, partials, and mixins. Plus, learn how to use SassScript to create complex functions from Sass lists and control statements.

## Topics include:

- Creating mixins
- Conditional statements and loops in SassScript
- Extending your mixins
- Working with lists and maps
